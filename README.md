# Doctracer
### This is a Command Line Utility tool to search files in a Linux file system.  
### This works with windows too, but might face some permission errors.

#### Using the tool:  
#### Go to the parent folder, you suspect your file might be in:  
`$doctracer ['FILE NAME']`
#### Additional options:  
`  -d | displays the complete path being travelled by the tool`  
`  -c | displays the contents of the file`  
`  -v | displays the version of the software`  

`  --help | displays help`  
`  -version | displays the version of the software`  

#### I have also implemented a basic browser based GUI tool for the same purpose.  
#### But CLI tool is more robust and should be prefered.  
#### To use the GUI tool, pass the following command from anywhere in the file-system  
`$doctracer-gui`
